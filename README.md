Othello Act 3 Scene 3 Lines 279-318
**OTHELLO**  Farewell, farewell!</br>
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.</br>
Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.</br>
**IAGO**, beginning to exit  My lord, I take my leave.</br>
**OTHELLO**</br>
<span style=color:purple;">Why did I marry?</span> This honest creature doubtless</br>
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.</br>
<p style="color:purple; font-size:15px">Begins to question his marriage with Desdemona</p>

**IAGO**, returning</br>
My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor</br>
To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.</br>
Although ’tis fit that <span style=color:orange;">Cassio</span> have his place—</br>
<p style="color:orange; font-size:15px">Iago tries to convince Othello that Cassio is somehow involved with Desdemona''s betrayal</p>
For sure he fills it up with great ability—</br>
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,</br>
You shall by that perceive him and his means.</br>
<p style="color:purple; font-size:15px">Tricking Othello into thinking Desdemona has betrayed him</p>
Note if your lady strain his entertainment</br>
With any strong or <span style=color:pink;">vehement</span>  importunity.</br>
<p style="color:pink; font-size:15px">Showing strong feeling, passionate</p>
Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,</br>
Let me be thought too busy in my fears—</br>
As worthy cause I have to fear I am—</br>
And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.</br>


**OTHELLO**  Fear not my government.</br>

**IAGO**  I once more take my leave.He exits.</br>


**OTHELLO**</br>
This fellow’s of exceeding <span style=color:blue;">honesty</span></br>
    <p style="color:blue; font-size:15px">Represents Othello's false trust in Iago. Ironic that Othello continues to mention honesty considering Iago is lying the entire time</p>
And knows all qualities with a learnèd spirit</br>

Of human dealings. If I do prove her <span style=color:maroon;">haggard</span></br>
<p style="color:maroon; font-size:15px">Meaning a trapped adult bird. Othello states that he will let Desdemona go if she is unloyal to him</p>
Though that her <span style=color:green;">jesses</span> were my dear heartstrings,</br>
<p style="color:green; font-size:15px">leather straps used like a leash to control hawks. Signifies Othello's relationship with Desdemona and how she is tied to his heart. Use of an analogy.</p>
 To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am <span style=color:red;">black</span></br> <p style="color:red; font-size:15px">References that he is black, suggesting a possible reason for why Desdemona betrayed him</p> 
    And have not those soft parts of conversation</br>
That chamberers have, or for I am declined</br>

Into the vale of years—yet that’s not much—</br>
She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief</br>
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,</br>
That we can call these delicate creatures ours</br>
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad</br>
And live upon the vapor of a <span style=color:purple;">dungeon</span></br>
Than keep a corner in the thing I love</br>
For others’ uses. <p style="color:purple; font-size:15px">Would rather be a toad living in a dark place like a dungeon than let Desdemona be with another man</p> 
Yet ’tis the plague of great ones;</br>
Prerogatived are they less than the base.</br>
’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.</br>
Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us</br>
When we do quicken. Look where she comes.</br>
